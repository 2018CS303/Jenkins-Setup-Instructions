# Installing Jenkins on OSX
- Download the installer from [here](http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/osx/latest)
- Directly opening the file will open Jenkins installer
- You can skip changing the home folder for now. By default the home folder is `/Users/Shared/Jenkins/Home`
- The initial admin password is located at `/Users/Shared/Jenkins/Home/secrets/initialAdminPassword`
- Rest all steps are same
